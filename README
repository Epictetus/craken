Craken
======

Craken is a rails plugin for managing and installing rake-centric crontab files 
over Capistrano.

What is a crontab?  A command list that cron will run at specified intervals.
What is cron?  A daemon to execute scheduled commands.

If you don't know these things already you should probably do a little research
before using this tool :)

Craken uses files called raketabs that are similar in every respect to crontab
files except the commands are rake tasks instead of arbitrary commands.

Why not just let it run arbitrary commands instead of limiting it to rake tasks?
The main issue this plugin attempts to alleviate is having to manage the 
rails environment configuration for multiple deployments.  Craken will set up the
crontab to change into the application's current directory and set rake to run in
the correct environment.

Example
=======

An example line from an example raketab file:

59 * * * * thing:to_do > /tmp/thing_to_do.log 2>&1

This will run the rake task thing:to_do every 59th minute after every hour.
The little redirect thing is added for effect.  Otherwise output will be mailed
to the user who the crontab is installed on.

When craken:install is run on the production box, the crontab will look like this:

### foo raketab
59 * * * * cd /home/thatguy/u/apps/foo/current && /usr/bin/rake --silent RAILS_ENV=production thing:to_do > /tmp/thing_to_do.log 2>&1
### foo raketab end


The "magic" part is this bit that crontab added:
  cd /home/thatguy/u/apps/foo/current && /usr/bin/rake --silent RAILS_ENV=production
